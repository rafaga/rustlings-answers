//hint
//An alternate way to handle concurrency between threads is to use
//a mpsc (multiple producer, single consumer) channel to communicate.
//With both a sending end and a receiving end, it's possible to
//send values in one thread and receive them in another.
//Multiple producers are possible by using clone() to create a duplicate
//of the original sending end.
//See https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html for more info.
